This project will provide https://github.com/ehcache/ehcache3[Ehcache 3] support in https://github.com/apache/shiro[Apache Shiro]

Build status: image:https://ehcache.ci.cloudbees.com/buildStatus/icon?job=ehcache-shiro[Ehcache@Cloudbees, link="https://ehcache.ci.cloudbees.com/job/ehcache-shiro/"]

= Sample Configurations

To enable it in Shiro application use the following configuration:

```
[main]
 cacheManager = org.ehcache.integrations.shiro.EhcacheShiroManager
 securityManager.cacheManager = $cacheManager
```

To set custom Ehcache configuration file use the following configuration:

```
[main]
 cacheManager = org.ehcache.integrations.shiro.EhcacheShiroManager
 cacheManager.cacheManagerConfigFile = /path/to/custom/configuration.xml
 securityManager.cacheManager = $cacheManager
```
== Cache Configuration Considerations

By default the `CacheManager` uses default Shiro specific EhCache configuration.
If you wish to change the cache settings, or configure your own `ehcache.xml` or `org.ehcache.CacheManager` instance, you will need to configure the cache region to ensure that Sessions are handled correctly.
You have to ensure that you have defined cache named `shiro-activeSessionCache` for Shiro's needs.

Please have a look at the default configuration file before creating your own.
